# Railway-Reservation-System-PHP
Designed a Railway ticket booking, reservation and cancellation system for users that wish to
travel via the Indian Railways.
Technologies used: HTML, PHP, Javascript, MySQL database.
The Indian Railways (IR) carries about 5.5 lakhs passengers in reserved accommodation every day. The Computerised Passenger Reservation System (PRS) facilates the booking and cancellation of tickets from any of the 4000 terminals (i.e. PRS booking window all over the countries). These tickets can be booked or cancelled for journeys commencing in any part   of India and ending in any other part, with travel time as long as 72hours and distance    upto several thousand kilometers.

In the given project we will be developing a website which will help users to find train details, book and cancel tickets and the exact rates of their tickets to the desired destination.

With the help of online booking people can book their tickets online through internet, sitting in their home by a single click of mouse. Using their credit cards people can easily get their tickets done within minutes.
